/**
 * Turns the option-backed columns of an import template into Excel dropdowns holding item codes.
 *
 * <p>Takes the values already resolved — a column index mapped to its allowed item codes — and does no
 * IO of its own. That is deliberate: this runs inside workbook serialisation, and reaching for a
 * database connection at that point ties a query to the lifetime of a file write.
 *
 * <p>Two ways to attach a list, chosen per column by its total length:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Inline list</b> — the values go straight into the validation formula. Excel caps that
 *       formula at 255 characters and POI enforces it by throwing, so a set that serialises longer
 *       cannot use this form. Most do fit: the option sets these columns point at run 30–50
 *       characters in total.
 *   <li><b>Range reference</b> — the values are written down a column of a hidden sheet and the
 *       formula points at that range. The formula is then a fixed-length address, so the 255-character
 *       cap stops applying however many options there are.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Inline is preferred where it fits, because the hidden sheet has a cost of its own: a reader can
 * unhide or delete it, and a deleted sheet leaves every dropdown pointing at a range that no longer
 * exists. Paying that only for the columns that need it keeps the common template to the two sheets
 * it has today.
 *
 * <p>A column with no resolvable options is skipped rather than failing the download. Missing option
 * data is a reason to hand back a template without one dropdown; it is not a reason to hand back
 * nothing.
 *
 * <p>Only the workbook's first sheet is touched — the template's own, the one people type into. The
 * instruction sheet beside it is prose.

/**
 * What the platform's Consultant Profile form saves.
 *
 * <p>One payload for create and edit, because the form is one form: basic details plus whatever
 * changed in the authorization table. The table arrives as changes rather than as a replacement
 * set — see {@code ConsultantService.applyAuthorizations} for why.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this is not an entity.</b> One save spans FOUR tables, and no entity is the shape of
 * it: the username belongs to {@link io.softa.starter.user.entity.UserProfile}, the email and
 * mobile to {@link io.softa.starter.user.entity.UserIdentity}, the Enabled switch to
 * {@link io.softa.starter.user.entity.ConsultantProfile}, and the grant rows to
 * {@link io.softa.starter.user.entity.ConsultantAuthorization}. Taking
 * {@code ConsultantProfile} as the parameter would carry exactly one of the five fields the
 * screen edits.
 *
 * <p>Nor can the generic model surface bridge it. A cascade write reaches a satellite whose FK
 * points AT the row being saved; {@code UserIdentity}'s FK points at the PROFILE, so there is no
 * forward path from the consultant record to the identifiers — which is deliberate, since those
 * identifiers are kept off the browsable person record on purpose.
 *
 * <p>And splitting it into four calls is not available either: the four writes have to land or fail
 * together. A grant saved without its minted membership, or a person created without the consultant
 * record, is a half-authorized consultant that the form cannot show and an operator cannot repair —
 * which is why {@code ConsultantService.save} is {@code @Transactional} over the whole payload.

     * client company being brought onto the implementation team. Login identifiers are globally
     * unique, so that person cannot be given a second profile with the same address; they are the
     * same person wearing another hat, which is exactly what the model represents. Null creates a
